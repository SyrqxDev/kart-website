            <h2>Round 5</h2>
            <p>
                Round 5 at Three Sisters Circuit, went fairly well in terms of my progress, the results don‚Äôt show but I made massive progress made over the weekend in terms of my driving as we had many different conditions and scenarios all weekend. Full wets and driving on slicks in the rain and dry. Which I showed good pace in all conditions, especially in the wet, where I was only 2 tenths of P2 every lap.
                <br><br>

                Heat 1: P21 ‚¨áÔ∏è P26<br>
                An incident on the first lap sent me to the back, once again out of my control and I couldn‚Äôt do anything to avoid it. Then a few laps later another similar incident that I unfortunately got caught up in, nothing I could‚Äôve done to avoid it, just a bit unlucky.
                <br><br>
                Heat 2: P7 ‚¨áÔ∏è P15<br>
                A good race with no incidents, just took too long to get into my rhythm which costed me a lot of positions, unfortunate but a good start the Sunday.
                <br><br>
                Heat 3: P17 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è P13<br>
                Another good race, however there was 3 false starts and a red flag due to the person on pole accelerating too early, which caused the track to go from dry to a greasy wet, that made it very dangerous for us on slicks which was proved by a Marshall being hit by a kart, in my opinion by the time they red flagged it they should‚Äôve let us change tyres, and that incident wouldn‚Äôt of happened.
                <br<br>
                B Final: P7 ‚¨áÔ∏è P21
                Really good pace, only 2 tenths off the leaders per lap, but I made a mistake braking to hard and just spun, frustrating but I still pushed on and gained a few places back, unfortunately I had 5 second penalty due to a dropped nose, If it wasn‚Äôt for the incident in heat 1 I would‚Äôve made the A final, however this is the best result in terms of starting positions I‚Äôve had all season, which just shows how much I‚Äôve improved since Dunkeswell with @racingperfection
                <br><br>
                Massive thanks to @racingperfection this weekend and @jensonwattsracing for the data and coaching all weekend. Massive gains.
                Also big thanks to @bullet.race.engines for the waft, absolutely insane power on the straight üèéÔ∏èüí®
                <br><br>
                Onto R6 at Warden Law, and the final round of the season, let‚Äôs make it a good one!<br>
